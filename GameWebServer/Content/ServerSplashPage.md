How to Setup The Hidden: Source
---

* Install [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about)
* Install [Half-Life 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220/ "Half-Life 2 on Steam")
* Download and install the [Hidden Client Installer](http://www.hidden-source.com/downloads.htm)

Now you should have an entry in your Steam Library for "Hidden: Source Beta 4b".  If you do, then you are all good to go!  Just connect to game.datyedyeguy.net to get your game on!

I recommend playing through the tutorial to lean how the Hidden controls, along with reading through the [Manual](http://www.hidden-source.com/downloads/manual.pdf) so that you aren't completely lost when you hop in.

How to Setup Garry's Mod
---

* Install [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about)
* Install [Garry's Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000 "Garry's Mod on Steam")
* Install [Counter-Strike: Source](http://store.steampowered.com/app/240/ "Counter-Strike: Source on Steam")
  * This is required due to maps on Garry's Mod using assets from Counter-Strike: Source.
* Subscribe to everything in [Datin's Playground Collection](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=349910372) on Steam.
  * This will download any custom maps/sounds/etc when you next startup Garry's Mod

Now, when you start up Garry's Mod, you should be able to connect to game.datyedyeguy.net and get your game on!
